		<p>
		Inspired by the Flappy Game Jam, this was a side-project done over the weekend with additional improvements added over the next week. Created in C++, just because it had been a while since I had last used it.
		</P>
		
		<p>
		If I were to do this project again I'd work on splitting the code up into modules. The main game class had feature creeped into this long super class.
		<br>
		Mainly I would focus on splitting the draw function into its own class. Right now it's this big function with all the game objects and the world hard coded in. 
		<br>
		I would add a draw function to each game object, which when called the game object would add themselves into a buffer. Then the buffer would be drawn onto the screen. 
		<br>
		This would also provide the benefit of supporting z depth, allowing the game objects' draw function to be called in any order.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		My high score is 22.

		Requires a windows platform to run. Tested on Windows 7 64-bit.
